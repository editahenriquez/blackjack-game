1) The goal of the game is to get a hand with a total value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
2) You can choose to "deal" to receive another card or "stand" to keep your current hand.
3) If your hand exceeds 21, you go "bust" and lose the round. The same applies to the dealer.
4) Once you stand, the dealer will drawing cards until their hand reaches your value or more.
5) If the dealer goes bust or has a lower hand value than you, you win the round.
6) If you both have the same hand value, it's a "tie".
